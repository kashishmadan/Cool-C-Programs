*A C program to find whether a user entered number is a perfect number or not.*

A perfect number is defined to be one which is equal to the sum of all its divisible number. For example let us consider a number 6, the numbers which are all divisible by 6 are 1, 2, 3. Then 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 . Thus 6 is a perfect number.
